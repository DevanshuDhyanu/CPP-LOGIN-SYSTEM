# CPP-LOGIN-SYSTEM
A simple file-based Login, Signup, and Password Recovery system built in C++ using fstream and OOP concepts.

🔐 C++ Login & Signup System

A basic Login–Signup–Password Recovery system built in C++ using OOP and file handling (fstream).
This project stores user details like username, email, password, and phone number in a text file and retrieves them during login/forgot-password operations.

🚀 Features:-
1.User Signup
2.User Login
3.Forgot Password feature
4.Stores data in loginData.txt
5.Reads/Writes using fstream
6.Custom record parsing using delimiters
7.Beginner-friendly and easy to extend

🛠 Technologies Used:-
1.C++
2.OOP (Classes & Objects)
3.File Handling (fstream)
4.VS Code

📁 File Structure
/cpp-login-system
│
├── main.cpp
├── loginData.txt
└── README.md

📸 Project Flow:-
1.User selects: Login / Signup / Forgot Password
2.Input is taken via getline()
3.Data stored with delimiter:
4.username*email*password*phone
5.Program reads data line-by-line and matches credentials

💡 Learning Outcomes:-
1.File handling in C++
2.Working with getline() and string parsing
3.Handling multiple user records
4.Writing clean OOP-based code
5.Debugging loops & file pointers

🧩 Future Improvements:-
1.Encrypt/hide passwords
2.Add validations (unique emails, strong passwords)
3.Shift to CSV/JSON format
4.Add UI menu in loop
5.Use SQLite/MySQL for storage
